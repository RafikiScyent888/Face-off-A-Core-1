# ⚔ FACE-OFF: A+ Core 1

An elimination **tournament** for **CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1201)** — Family Feud
buzzers, a Jeopardy point board, hidden Daily Doubles, teams knocked out each
round, and a head-to-head Lightning Final. Built for the Cyber Warrior Program.

Students join by scanning a QR code or clicking a link. They pick their own team
name and color, type their own names, buzz in from their phone or laptop, and
type their team's answer for you to judge.

Runs entirely in the browser. No install, no accounts for students, no app.

## Quick start

**Just want to see it?** Open `demo.html` — it shows the host screen and two
student devices side by side in one window.

**Running it in class:**

1. Open `index.html` on the projector → **Host a Game**.
2. Students scan the QR or go to the link and enter the 4-letter room code.
3. You tell each student which team they're on. They tap that team, type their
   name, and the first one in becomes captain (picks the team name and color).
4. Click **Start Game →**. The bracket builds itself from your team count.

## How the tournament works

It's a bracket. Teams get knocked out until two are left, and those two settle
it head to head.

```
   8 teams  →  Round 1  →  cut bottom 2  →  6 teams
                          Round 2  →  cut bottom 2  →  4 teams
                          Round 3  →  cut bottom 2  →  2 teams
                                   ⚡ LIGHTNING FINAL ⚡
```

Scores **carry over** the whole way, so a strong early round still counts in the
final. Point values **grow each round** — Round 1 tops out at 500, Round 2 at
1,000, Round 3 at 1,500 — so a team behind early can still climb back.

### Playing a board

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| You click a point value | The question goes up on the projector and on every student device |
| Any team hits **BUZZ** | First buzz wins. That team gets **15 seconds** |
| The team types an answer | *Anyone* on the team can type — they talk it out, one types |
| You click **✓ Correct** | They score, and they pick the next clue |
| You click **✕ Incorrect** (or time runs out) | That team is locked out and the board **reopens to every other team still in the bracket** |
| All teams miss | You reveal the answer and move on |

Buzz order is shown on screen (#1, #2, #3…) so nobody argues about who was first.

### Eliminations

When the board is cleared — or whenever you click **End this round early** — you
get a standings screen with the bottom two already marked for elimination.

- **Click any team to change who goes out.** You have the final say.
- If teams are **tied at the cut line**, the screen says so in yellow and waits
  for you to pick. It will not guess.
- It won't let you continue until exactly the right number are selected.

Eliminated teams keep their device. Questions and answers still appear on it so
they can keep reviewing and follow the standings — they just can't buzz.

### ⚡ The Lightning Final

The last two teams go head to head. No board — just rapid-fire questions worth
**500 each**, 10 seconds apiece, fastest buzz takes it. Miss, and the other team
gets the rest of the clock. If they're tied when the questions run out, it goes
to **sudden death**.

### Daily Doubles

Hidden randomly on every board — **you never know where they are either**. Never
in the cheapest rows. The team that uncovers one wagers up to their own score,
answers alone, and there's **no steal**. Bigger boards hide two.

## Class vs Class

Turn on **Class vs Class** in Settings and the teams split into two classes —
name them whatever you like (`PERIOD 2` / `PERIOD 4`, etc.) — and the tournament
becomes a cross-class knockout, matched **team against team**.

- **Every team is matched one against one across the classes.** Best in Class A
  faces best in Class B, second faces second, and so on. Matchups are re-seeded
  at the start of every round, so they stay level as the field shrinks.
- **Each clue belongs to one matchup, and only those two teams may buzz.**
  Clues rotate through the matchups in order, so every duel gets the same
  number. The board carries a matchup rail with the duel that is up next lit;
  students who aren't in it see `NOT YOUR MATCHUP` on their buzzer. A steal
  after a wrong answer opens to the opponent only, not the room.
- **The loser of each matchup is eliminated,** so both classes halve every round
  down to one champion apiece, and those two meet in the Lightning Final. The
  eliminations screen shows one row per matchup; click a team to flip which side
  of its duel goes out.

```
CLASS A: 4 ┐ ┐
           ├─┤ each round every A team duels a B team,
CLASS B: 4 ┘ ┘ the loser goes out — down to 1 vs 1
                            └─ ⚡ LIGHTNING FINAL ⚡
```

An odd team out draws a **BYE** — it sits the round out and can't be
eliminated. If one class sweeps a round and wipes the other out entirely, that
class has won the class battle, and its survivors play down to the last two for
the final.

A **class scoreboard** runs across the top of the board the whole game — every
team's points feed their class total, including teams already eliminated. So
there are two things to win: the team trophy and the class trophy.

Teams are split down the middle automatically (first half Class A, second half
Class B). On the join screen each team card has a small **A / B badge — click it
to move that team to the other class** before you start.

## Running the game

### The answer key on the host screen

The host screen never shows the answer on its own. Two things follow from that:

- **The answer key is covered.** The strip along the bottom of a live clue
  reads `Host only — ANSWER HIDDEN` until you click **👁 Reveal answer** (or
  press **A**). The button becomes **🙈 Hide answer**, so you can check the key
  and put it straight back — useful when the host screen is mirrored to a
  projector, shared in a call, or just visible over your shoulder. It re-covers
  itself on the next clue either way.
- **You see the question, not the typing.** While a team is on the clock the
  host screen shows the clue and the timer, nothing more. Their answer appears
  the moment they submit it — keystrokes were never transmitted, so there was
  nothing live to watch anyway.

Revealing the key is **host-side only**: students' devices are not told, and the
answer still only reaches them when you hit **Show answer & move on**.

### Shuffling the teams

**🔀 Shuffle members** in the lobby redeals every student who has joined across
the teams at random. Team sizes stay within one of each other, captains are
reassigned to whoever lands first on each team, and nobody has to rejoin —
students' phones follow them to their new team on their own. Use it to break up
the friends who all piled into Team 1.

### How many rounds get played

With **three or more teams** the bracket works out its own length. With
**exactly two teams** there is nobody to eliminate, so you say how long the game
runs: **Rounds before the final** in Settings sets how many boards are played
head-to-head before the Lightning Final, with no elimination screens in between.
The field is greyed out at any other team count, where the bracket still
decides.

### Not repeating questions

Used clues are remembered **across tournaments**, not just within one, so a
class can play several games back to back — and the host can reload the
projector mid-class — without seeing a question twice. Each board also picks its
clues at random from within each row's slice of the category's difficulty ramp,
and the categories are redealt in a new order every tournament.

**Settings** shows how much of the pool is left with a **Reset pool** button.
With 668 clues and the default 8 teams at 60 minutes, that is about 13
tournaments of completely repeat-free play before the pool recycles on its own.

The memory lives in that browser's local storage under a key of its own, so this
game does not tread on the other Face-Off games hosted from the same site. A
different computer, a different browser, or a cleared cache starts fresh.

### On the students' phones

- **Enter submits.** Enter sends the answer, Shift+Enter makes a new line. The
  Submit button still works; it was often hidden under the phone keyboard.
  Enter also submits the name, team name, and wager boxes.
- **The answer box clears itself.** Anything half-typed when the host moves on is
  dropped, so the next question opens on an empty box instead of last question's
  answer waiting to be sent by reflex.

## Class size and running time

Set **number of teams** (2–16), **students per team** (2–8), and **tournament
length** in Settings. The panel shows your exact bracket as you change them.

| Setup | Teams | Students |
|---|---|---|
| One class of 40 | 8 × 5 (default) | 40 |
| One class of 80 | 10 × 8 | 80 |
| **Two classes of 40** | **16 × 5** — 8 teams per class | **80** |

**Tournament length** scales the boards so the whole bracket fits your period:

| Length | Each board | Lightning Final |
|---|---|---|
| 30 min | 3 categories × 3 | 8 questions |
| 45 min | 4 × 3 | 10 |
| 60 min | 4 × 4 | 10 |
| 90 min | 5 × 5 | 12 |
| 120 min | 6 × 5 | 15 |

With 8 teams per class the bracket is **4 rounds** (8→6→4→2→1). At the 60-minute
preset that's four 4×4 boards plus the final.

**One caution above ~90 students:** Firebase's free plan allows 100 devices
connected at once. 80 students plus the host is 81, comfortably inside it.

## Other settings (⚙ in the top bar)

Seconds to answer, Lightning Final seconds, minimum Daily Double wager, sound
on/off, and whether a wrong answer **deducts** points (off by default — with
open steals, deducting punishes the teams brave enough to buzz).

You can also nudge any score by hovering a team card and clicking **+ / −**, and
click any team card to hand them board control.

Shrinking the roster settings never strands a student: the game refuses to set
students-per-team below a roster that's already fuller than that, and asks for
confirmation before removing teams that already have students on them.

## Local Mode vs Live Mode

| | Local Mode (default) | Live Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | none | one free Firebase project, ~10 min |
| Students join from | another tab on the host computer only | any phone or laptop |
| Use it for | testing, single-screen play with keyboard buzzers | actual class |

**To go live, follow [`FIREBASE-SETUP.md`](FIREBASE-SETUP.md).** The home screen
tells you which mode you're in.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Push these files to the repo root, then **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from
a branch → `main` / `(root)`**. Give it a minute and it's live at
`https://rafikiscyent888.github.io/Face-off-A-Core-1/`.

### GitHub or GitLab?

**GitHub, and it isn't close for you.** Your other course material already lives
there, GitHub Pages is one dropdown to turn on, and you already know the
workflow from VS Code. GitLab Pages needs a `.gitlab-ci.yml` build file to do
the same job. There's no feature here you'd gain by switching.

## The questions

The board is built from the **Core-1-quizzes** practice bank at
<https://rafikiscyent888.github.io/Core-1-quizzes/> — the same questions students drill on
their own, so the game reviews exactly what they studied.

`questions-core1.js` is **generated** from that bank. Regenerate it whenever the
quiz site changes:

```bash
python3 tools/build-questions.py            # expects ../Core-1-quizzes
python3 tools/build-questions.py /path/to/Core-1-quizzes
```

The script turns each **quiz objective into one category** and uses the
**correct multiple-choice option as the answer key**. Clues inside a category
are ordered easiest first, hardest last — that ordering becomes the 100 → 500
rows on the board. Categories are interleaved by exam domain, so a drawn board
mixes topics instead of stacking one domain.

Clue shape, if you ever hand-edit:

```js
{ q: "The question students see.",
  a: "The answer only you see",
  alt: ["another phrasing you'd accept"],   // optional
  obj: "1.2" }                              // objective, shown on the host screen
```

### What's in there now

**668 board questions** across **25 categories** — one per 220-1201
objective — plus **48 Lightning Final questions**. Far more than a single
tournament needs.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The game — all markup and styling |
| `app.js` | Game engine: host console, student device, networking |
| `questions-core1.js` | The question bank — generated from the quiz site |
| `tools/build-questions.py` | **The question bank — this is the file you'll edit** |
| `firebase-config.js` | Paste your Firebase keys here to go live |
| `qr.js` | Self-contained QR generator (no CDN, works offline) |
| `demo.html` | Host + 2 student devices side by side, for testing alone |
| `FIREBASE-SETUP.md` | Step-by-step guide to enabling phone join |
| `.nojekyll` | Empty file — tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing |

There are **no external dependencies**. Nothing is fetched from a CDN, so it
works on a locked-down school network and even fully offline in Local Mode.

## Browser support

Any current Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari, desktop or mobile. Sound uses the
Web Audio API — on some phones the first tap unlocks it, which the join button
handles.

## Troubleshooting

**Students stuck on "Looking for room…"** — you're in Local Mode. See
`FIREBASE-SETUP.md`. If you're already in Live Mode, the school network is
probably blocking `*.firebaseio.com`.

**A student refreshed and lost their spot** — they just rejoin with the same
name on the same team and reclaim their seat.

**Two students on one laptop** — add a seat number to the link:
`…#/play/ABCD/1` and `…#/play/ABCD/2` are two separate players.

**Everything died mid-game** — scores live on the host screen. Don't reload the
host tab; if you must, use the keyboard buzzers (`1`–`9`, `0`, `-`, `=`, `q`,
`w`, `e`, `r`) and adjust scores with the +/− buttons.
